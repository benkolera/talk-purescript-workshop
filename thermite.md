# Thermite

Note that at any time you can get help by either asking Ben or peeking at the Answers branch. :)

## Exercise 1 - Warm Up

Make sure that you're at: http://localhost:1337/#thermite/intro

See that this page displays and check out src/ThermiteEx/Intro.purs

Follow through the comments to explain the Spec and Render concepts + how we fit this into react and the dom.

## Exercise 2 - State

Make sure you are here: http://localhost:1337/#thermite/state and editing src/ThermiteEx/State.purs

Make it show the state that we've put in when creating the class!

## Exercise 3 - Actions

Make sure you're at http://localhost:1337/#thermite/actions and editing src/ThermiteEx/Actions.purs

Note that those buttons don't work yet. Lets make them work!

If perform action doesn't make sense, be sure to read the purescript pattern matching section. Esp
the bit around ADTs! Also pay close attention to the signature of PerformAction.

## Exercise 4 - Components / Reuse

Make sure you are http://localhost:1337/#thermite/components and editing src/ThermiteEx/Actions.purs

We want two counters on this page.

You're going to need to crack the puzzle of Thermite.focus and Data.Lens for tuples and either to get this one.

## Exercise 5 - Lists

Make sure you are http://localhost:1337/#thermite/lists and editing src/ThermiteEx/Lists.purs

Now we are going to make a page that has a list of counters that we can add a new counter with a button.

You're going to have to make your own types for state and actions and write a prism for you action ADT.

See Thermite.foreach for a good start!
