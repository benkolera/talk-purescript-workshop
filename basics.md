# Purescript Basics

If you haven't seen much of purescript before, you probably want to skim over these chapters:

https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-functions-and-records

https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-the-eff-monad

Which should be the minimum set of understanding that you'll need to wander through this stuff without
being too lost. You should be able to follow examples to get a feel and not completely understand the 
concepts. 

After you've skimmed these things, scoot over to the [thermite.md|Examples] and see how you go! :)
